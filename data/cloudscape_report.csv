aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::Instance,i-001,ec2_01,EC2 instances should use IMDSv2,CS 1.3/S2d,COMPLIANT,"This control checks whether the EC2 instance metadata version is configured with Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2). The control fails if the EC2 instance's metadata option ""HttpTokens"" is set to ""optional""."
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::Instance,i-002,ec2_02,EC2 instances should not have a public IP address,CS 1.5/S1,COMPLIANT,This control checks whether Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances have a public IP association. The control fails if the publicIp field is present in the Amazon EC2 instance configuration item.
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::Instance,i-003,ec2_03,EC2 instances should be managed by SSM,"CS 1.9/S2,CS 1.8/S4,CS 1.4/S21",NON_COMPLIANT,This control checks whether the EC2 instance in your account are managed by Systems Manager (SSM). The control fails if the EC2 instance is not managed by SSM.
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup,sg-001,default,Security groups should block incoming traffic to abused ports,"CS 1.6/S1h,CS 1.5/S5a",COMPLIANT,"This control checks whether the security group allows unrestricted incoming traffic to commonly abused ports. This control fails if the security group has a rule which allows unrestricted incoming traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to any of the following TCP ports:20 (FTP), 21 (FTP), 3389 (RDP), 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL). These services should generally be deployed into private subnets. If there is a business requirement to expose these services, IP restrictions should be applied to only allow access from authorised networks where possible to reduce the number of attack vectors."
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup,sg-002,sg_01,Security groups should block incoming traffic on TCP port 22,"CS 1.6/S1h,CS 1.5/S5a",NON_COMPLIANT,This control checks whether the security group allows unrestricted incoming SSH traffic. This control fails if the security group has an unrestricted (0.0.0.0/0) inbound rule to TCP port 22. SSH should not be accessible directly from the internet to reduce the resource's exposure to risk. Remote administration of workloads should be performed through the use of AWS Systems Manager Session Manager or Fleet Manager. This control checks whether the default security group of a VPC allows inbound or outbound traffic. This control fails if the default security group has one or more inbound or outbound traffic rules.
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup,sg-003,default,Default security group should not allow any traffic,CS 1.5/S3,NON_COMPLIANT,"This control checks whether the default security group of a VPC allows inbound or outbound traffic. This control fails if the default security group has one or more inbound or outbound traffic rules. When a specific security group is not specified, resources such as EC2 instances will automatically be attached to the default security group of a VPC. To mitigate the risk of unintended network access, the default security group should not be used and it should not contain any rules that allow network traffic. This control checks whether the security group allows unrestricted incoming SSH traffic. This control fails if the security group has an unrestricted (0.0.0.0/0) inbound rule to TCP port 22."
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup,sg-004,sg_02,Security groups should block incoming traffic on TCP port 22,"CS 1.6/S1h,CS 1.5/S5a",NON_COMPLIANT,This control checks whether the security group allows unrestricted incoming SSH traffic. This control fails if the security group has an unrestricted (0.0.0.0/0) inbound rule to TCP port 22. SSH should not be accessible directly from the internet to reduce the resource's exposure to risk. Remote administration of workloads should be performed through the use of AWS Systems Manager Session Manager or Fleet Manager.
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::Subnet,subnet-001,vpc_subnet_01,VPC subnets should not be assigned public IP addresses,CS 1.5/S1,COMPLIANT,"This control checks whether the VPC subnet is assigned a public IP address. The control fails if the VPC subnet is assigned a public IP address. A VPC subnet is a part of the VPC, with its own rules for traffic. Subnets with automatic Public IP assignment can inadvertently expose the instances within this subnet to the internet. Hence, it is recommended to to ensure VPC subnet is not assigned a public IP address."
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::Volume,vol-001,ebs-01,EBS volumes should be encrypted,CS 1.3/S2a,COMPLIANT,"This control checks whether the attached EBS volume is encrypted. The control fails if the EBS volume is in an attached state and is not encrypted. For an added layer of security of your sensitive data in EBS volumes, you should enable EBS encryption at-rest. !>**Warning**</br>Encryption can only be enabled during volume creation."
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::Volume,vol-002,ebs-01,EBS volumes should be backed up by AWS Backup,"CS 1.6/S3b,CS 1.2/S2",NON_COMPLIANT,This control checks whether Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes are protected by a backup plan. The control fails if the Amazon EBS volume is not covered by a backup plan. Using AWS Backup allows for automation and consolidation of backup tasks that would otherwise have to be performed service by service. 
aws,8.88888E+11,cloubot-mock-account,AWS::EC2::VPC,vpc-001,vpc_01,VPCs should have flow logs enabled,"CS 1.9/S2,CS 1.5/S6a,CS 1.3/S2c",NON_COMPLIANT,"This control checks whether the VPC flow logs are found and enabled for the VPC. The control fails if the VPC has no VPC flow logs configured or the traffic filter is not ""ALL"".  Flow logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can detect anomalous traffic or provide insight during incident response or security reviews."
